CiderBridge - Securely Backup Photos & Videos from iPhone to PC
=============================================================

System Requirements:
--------------------
1. Operating System: Windows 10 or Windows 11.
2. A functional USB cable to connect your iPhone (original cable recommended).
3. Apple Drivers installed (usually installed automatically with iTunes).

Usage Instructions - IMPORTANT: Read before starting!
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Unlock your iPhone:
   You MUST unlock your iPhone screen *before* connecting the cable and before clicking any buttons in the software.
   If asked "Trust this computer?" on your iPhone, tap "Trust" and enter your passcode.

2. iPhone Transfer Settings ("Keep Originals"):
   To prevent errors and disconnections, ensure your iPhone transfers files in their original format without real-time conversion.
   - Go to "Settings" on your iPhone.
   - Scroll down and select "Photos".
   - Scroll to the bottom to the "TRANSFER TO MAC OR PC" section.
   - Select "Keep Originals".

3. Select Source:
   Click the yellow "Select iPhone (MTP)" button in the software. Ensure your iPhone is detected.

4. Select Destination:
   Click "Select Destination" and choose the folder on your PC where you want to back up your photos.
   The software will automatically create a subfolder with today's date (e.g., 07-12-2025).

5. Start Backup:
   Click the green "Start Backup" button.

6. Select Backup Mode:
   A popup will ask you to choose a mode:
   - Optimize (Recommended): Automatically converts HEIC photos to JPG (saves space and easier to view on Windows).
   - Keep Originals: Copies files exactly as they are (maintains HEIC format).
   
   Select your preferred option and wait for the process to complete.
